## 💻 But… You Use jQuery?! 😱  

Yes, we do, and we do so **deliberately and unapologetically.** 😘 While the world has moved on to React, Vue, Svelte, and other modern frameworks, we chose jQuery for **practical** and **philosophical** reasons:  

- 🌟 **Simplicity & Familiarity** – jQuery is lightweight, easy to use, and gets the job done with elegance.  
- 🌟 **Speed of Development** – We focus on **functionality first** without unnecessary complexity.  
- 🌟 **Compatibility** – It integrates smoothly with Dart Connect without adding unnecessary dependencies.  
- 🌟 **Pure Efficiency** – Our tool doesn’t need a full-blown reactive framework when jQuery can handle the job gracefully.  

We deeply understand the modern ecosystem, and trust us, we’ve explored the alternatives. But for this project, **jQuery just makes sense.** If you dislike jQuery, that’s totally fine! We still welcome your contributions, and who knows—**maybe one day we’ll revisit things.**  

Until then, we embrace our jQuery world with **confidence and cuteness.** 🎀💖
